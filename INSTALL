Quick instructions how to build smash.
SMASH is known to compile and work on gcc >= 4.8 and clang >= 3.2,
as it uses c++11 features.

It requires the following libraries:
* the GNU Scientific Library.
* boost filesystem >= 1.49
* yaml-cpp 0.5.1 (see below if you need to install manually)

Building SMASH
==============

Build it in a seperate directory:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  make

Run it with specific settings:
  vi config_general.txt
  ./smash

Run the various tests:
  make test

Tarball mash:
  ./bin/smash_tarball


Installing yaml-cpp manually
============================

* get the yaml-cpp tarball
  % wget http://yaml-cpp.googlecode.com/files/yaml-cpp-0.5.1.tar.gz
* unpack
  % tar -xf yaml-cpp-0.5.1.tar.gz
* build in a build directory
  % cd yaml-cpp-0.5.1
  % mkdir build
  % cd build
  % cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  % make
  % make install
  Replace <prefix> above with the place where you want to install yaml-cpp. You
  can e.g. install it to $HOME.
* If you did not install you a standard location you'll need to set the
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable for SMASH to find it:
  % export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<prefix>/lib/pkgconfig
