Remaining Questions:

- What is the correct weighing prescription? How to chose delta t?

- How do I handle the different rho masses for the incoming particles? 

- Include only photons in output or both final state particles?

- How to use GIT properly and how to document my code?


- In the end should I use find_actions_in_cell(..) like for the dileptons or better implement it more generally with all three alternatives(neighbor, surrounding)?

- How will I implement the reactions with their cross sections?
-> How to take into account these Breit-Wigner distributions for resonances in the final state?
-> What about the reaction with the intermediate a1?

- Is it better for the future to let ScatterActionPhoton inherit from ScatterActionMesonMeson?

- Can the photon_output be created/instantiated as suggested?
-> Is there maybe a better format?



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remaining tasks:

-forbidden u-channel in reaction b should be deleted
-weigh the photons correctly in generate_final_state
-read in number of fractional photons from config file on SMASH start


- log entries in ScatterAction construction
