## Code Documentation

We use [doxygen](http://doxygen.org) for generating documentation from our code.

### How to build docs with doxygen yourself

You need to have doxygen version 1.8.4 installed. Then just call:

    make doc

and you'll find `doc/html/index.html` in your build directory.

Additionally, there are two more targets that can be used to test the completeness of the documentation:

    make undocumented
    make undocumented_count

Both are building the doxygen documentation only for completely documented entities, but the main purpose of both is that all warnings are displayed when running. So, the first target outputs all doxygen warnings about missing documentation and the second one only counts (and outputs) the number of warnings.

#### Creating the User Guide

Call

    make user

to obtain the files in `doc/user/index.html`

### What to document in the code

Code documentation has two important purposes:
* Documenting how interfaces are supposed to be used. Doxygen creates all the boilerplate for this task by parsing the class inheritance and function signatures into nice HTML pages. Via special comments this can be completed to full API documentation.
* Documenting why things are as they are. Often the how code works is more obvious than why it was done this way and not differently. This information can be very useful to understand design choices and follow along original ideas.

### How to write good doxygen comments

Doxygen is very flexible in the [comments it accepts for documentation generation](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html). In general documentation should look like this:

``` cpp
    /**
     * \brief Brief description of the class
     * Full description of the class.
     */
    class Something {
     public:
      /**
       * <Explain what this function does>
       * \param[in] x <Explain input parameter>
       * \param[out] y <Explain input parameter that gets modified within fun>
       * \return <Explain what the function returns>
       * \throw ExceptionClass <The conditions under which the function is
       * expected to throw the named exception>
       */
      int fun(int x);
    };
```

Doxygen has a lot of commands for markup. In general you can work with [Markdown](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/markdown.html) (known from Wiki syntax).
But for all the connection to code and some special layout commands, refer to the [Special Commands in Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/commands.html).

#### Rules

The code documentation follows a few rules concerning the formatting and the question what should be documented:

* The general rule is that all functions need to be documented.
* All parameters (if important also the parameter ranges), the return value and exceptions that are thrown by the function  need to be documented.
* Use `\param[in]` for input parameters; `\param[out]` for input parameters that get modified within the function; `\return` for what is returned; `\throw` for exception that are thrown
* Template parameters are documented with `\tparam`
* Syntax for inline math is `\f$ <math expression> \f$`
* Use square brackets for units `[...]`
* Check if the documentation is properly parsed by doxygen with `make doc` (see below)
* Doxygen comment formatting:
  * 1-line
```
    /// <comment>
```
  * multi-line (pay attention to alignment)
```
    /**
     * <comments>
     */
```
* normal comment formatting:
  * 1-line
```
    // <comment>
```
  * multi-line (more compact)
```
    /* <comment line 1>
     * <comment line n> */
```


### How to insert references to publications

In order to refer to a paper inside a doxygen comment, the `iref` command should be used:

``` cpp
    /** ... this function implements ... as described in \iref{XXX}. */
    int fun int(x);
```

Here, `XXX` should be the BibTex key for the paper from Inspire. In order to find it, search for the paper on http://inspirehep.net and then click on 'BibTex', which will show the complete BibTex entry (you only need the key, which is in the first line). Doxygen will automatically translate `\iref{XXX}` into a link to the paper on Inspire.

After adding a new reference, you should run the script `doc/get_bibtex.sh`, which will update the file [smash.bib](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/pm/projects/smash/repository/revisions/master/entry/doc/smash.bib) by fetching the BibTex entries of all `iref` references from Inspire.


### User Guide

The User Guide will be written in the code base, i.e., documentation of configuration options are described where they are used. Comments that are in normal doxygen format do not appear in the User Guide. Instead only multi-line comments of the form `/*!\Userguide ... */` will be used. Example:

``` cpp
    /*!\Userguide
     * \if user
     * This text ONLY appears in the User Guide (useful for a headline that the normal documentation already has in the preceeding section)
     * \endif
     * \ifnot user
     * This text will appear only in the Developer Docs
     * \endif
     *
     * Text that appears in both the User Guide and the Developer Docs.
     */
```

The workflow is that `doc/CMakeLists.txt` extracts all `/*!\Userguide ... */` Sections into `doc/userguide.dox` which is then included into the User Guide Doxygen tree. Currently, the cmake script processes all `src/include/*.h` and `src/*.cc` files.

## Coding Rules

There are two parts:
* [ALICE OÂ² C++ Coding Guidelines](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/~smash/extra/code_guidelines/cppguide.xml) - These guidelines are concerned with the language conventions we follow.
* [Google Naming & Formatting Rules](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/~smash/extra/code_guidelines/cppnaming.xml) - The rules enforce consistent coding style throughout our code base.

It can be very instructive to study the [CERT Coding Standards](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/CERT+Coding+Standards) as well. Secure coding is not as important for SMASH as for most other projects. However, secure coding basically is a strategy for avoiding program errors, and as such it is interesting for every C++ project.

Our Naming & Formatting Rules follow the Google Styleguide. We keep a copy of the relevant sections to be able to make small adjustments and hide the C++ Coding Guidelines sections.

Note that we use `clang-format` for formatting (see README for installation, usage explained below), so you can just use that instead of having to worry about formatting by hand in accordance with the style guide.

A notable naming rule is that class member variables have to end in an underscore (`_`).


### Specific Naming Conventions for SMASH

* for particles going into or coming out of an interaction we use:
  * `incoming_particles`
  * `outgoing_particles`
* for lists of `ParticleData` objects (type `ParticleList`) we use
  * `particle_list`
* for lists of `PdgCode` objects we use
  * `pdg_list`
* to enumerate particles in any context we use:
  * `particle_a, particle_b, particle_c, ...`

### Exceptions to the Rules

1. Ensure that there is only one statement per line.

``` cpp
if (bla) {
  foo();
}
```

Don't put bla and foo on the same line to better show what the code is doing.

2. Use CamelCase for enum variants.

```cpp
enum class MyEnum {
  FirstVariant,
  SecondVariant,
  ThirdVariant
}
```

### How to add an enum for a new configuration value

If a new option is added to the `config.yaml`, it should be done in the following way:

* Add `enum class` to `forwarddeclarations.h`.
* Add `Configuration::Value` cast operator overload.
* Document possible strings in `config.yaml` and User Guide.

### Code formatting with `clang-format`

You can run `clang-format` to automatically format all code in SMASH correctly using the following command in the SMASH root directory:

```
    for i in src/*.cc src/include/*.h src/tests/*.cc src/tests/*.h; do clang-format -i $i; done;
```

If clang-format does changes that don't look good, you can disable it locally using comments like this:

```
    // clang-format off
    ...
    // clang-format on
```

## Static code analysis & coding style

The SMASH source code can be checked via:

```
      make cpplint 2>&1 | grep -v 'Done processing'
      make cppcheck
```

## Runtime memory checking with valgrind

The SMASH binary is regularly checked by:

```
      valgrind -v ./smash
```

## Profiling / Benchmarking

### GPROF

You can tell cmake to create a build for profiling with the `Profiling` build
type:

```
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Profiling ..
```

This will compile the smash code like `Release` mode, but with the `-pg` flag
to instrument the code and create a `gmon.out` file whenever you run a binary.
You can look at the `gmon.out` information with `gprof`.

```
    # first run smash to create the gmon.out file
    ./smash
    # now run gprof to see the profile information
    gprof smash|less
```

### Perf

A different method for profiling SMASH uses performance counters and the `perf`
tool on Linux. `perf` uses a feature of the CPU (and OS support) to count
performance relevant events in the normal execution of the program. Therefore,
SMASH should execute as "normal as possible", but with meta information about
the program to improve the reporting capabilities of \c perf. To get useful
results compile SMASH in `RelWithDebInfo` mode, i.e. via

```
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
```

Now you can use `perf` to collect information for subsequent investigation
(similar to `gprof`) or have it collect global stats directly and output them
after execution. Here are some of the common uses:

```
    # Collect default information about the execution (cycles, IPC, stalls,
    # branching, ...)
    perf stat -B ./smash
```
```
    # Collect detailed information about a run (collecting 'cycles')
    perf record --call-graph dwarf ./smash
    perf report --stdio
```

`perf` also supports to collect different information, but this can be very CPU
specific and also hard to interpret. Therefore, I recommend to focus only on
`cycles` (for `record`) and the default `stat` output.
A short overview what to make of the `stat` numbers:

* `instructions`:
This is the total number of instructions that the CPU had to execute to run the
program. In general, less is better; but the actual run time is determined by how
many instructions the CPU can execute in parallel (current CPUs can issue up to
4 instructions per cycle). You can see this ratio right behind the
`instructions` value, such as: `2,384,060,126 instructions  # 1.59 insns per
cycle`. The bigger that number the better. But it is really hard to judge the
efficiency of a program by this number. (After all there could be unnecessarily
long instruction sequences that have a high IPC, while a shorter sequence would
be faster overall, but with a lower IPC.)

* `branches` and `branch-misses`
Branches are places where the CPU cannot be certain which code needs to be
executed next. But instead of waiting for the decision the CPU predicts the jump
address and starts executing. If it then determines it miss-predicted it has to
roll back its work and start again from the correct address. Therefore
miss-predictions are costly and should be reduced to a minimum. The branch
miss-prediction ratio is shown in the `perf` output.

* `page-faults`
A page fault happens when a memory address is accessed that has not yet been
allocated in physical memory by the operating system. In that case the TLB
(translation lookaside buffer) entry cannot be determined by the CPU and the OS
has to interrupt the execution of the program to allocate the page and fill it
in the page table for use in the TLB. Page-faults must happen after memory
allocations (unless `malloc` is able to reuse previously deallocated memory)
and are therefore an indicator for "irresponsible" memory allocations.

### Flame Graphs

Flame graphs are a useful way to visualize the call graph output of a profiler.
To generate them, do:

```
    git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph
    export FGPATH=$(pwd)/FlameGraph
```

This gives you a collection of Perl scripts for flame graph generation.
Different profilers are supported. In the following example we are using perf on
Linux:

```
    perf record -F 99 -g ./smash
    perf script | $FGPATH/stackcollapse-perf.pl > out.perf-folded
    $FGPATH/flamegraph.pl out.perf-folded > perf.svg
    firefox perf.svg
```

If you get mangled names of the functions, try this as a second line

```
    perf script | c++filt | $FGPATH/stackcollapse-perf.pl > out.perf-folded
```

The x axis represents the total duration that the corresponding stack frame
lived for. The order and the colors are arbitrary and optimized for readability.
The y axis represents the position on the stack.
