 * different running modi. Since the abstraction of these differences should not
 * incur any overhead, the design is built around the Policy pattern.
 *
 * The Policy pattern was defined by Andrei Alexandrescu in his book "Modern C++
 * Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied". Addison-Wesley:
 * > A policy defines a class interface or a class template interface.
 * > The interface consists of one or all of the following: inner type
 * > definitions, member functions, and member variables.
 * The policy pattern can also be understood as a compile-time variant of the
 * strategy pattern.
 *
 * The \p Modus template parameter defines the "policy" of the Experiment class.
 * It determines several aspects of the experiment execution *at compile time*.
 * The original strategy pattern would select these differences *at run time*,
 * thus incurring an overhead. This overhead becomes severe in cases where calls
 * to strategy/policy functions are done very frequently. Using the policy
 * pattern, the compiler can fully optimize: It creates a new instance of all
 * functions in Experiment for all different Modus types.
