/** NucleusModus: Provides a modus for colliding nuclei.
 *
 * To use this modus, chose
 * \code
 * General:
 *      MODUS: Nucleus
 * \endcode
 * in the configuration file.
 *
 * Options for NucleusModus go in the "Modi"â†’"Nucleus" section of the
 * configuration:
 *
 * \code
 * Modi:
 *      Nucleus:
 *              # definitions here
 * \endcode
 *
 * The following directives are understood:
 *
 * `SQRTSNN:` Defines the energy of the collision as center-of-mass
 * energy in the collision of one participant each from both nuclei.
 * Since not all participants have the same mass, and hence
 * \f$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\f$ is different for \f$NN\f$ = proton+proton and
 * \f$NN\f$=neutron+neutron, you can specify which \f$NN\f$-pair you
 * want this to refer to with `SQRTS_N`
 *
 * `SQRTS_N:` The "N" that's used for `SQRTSNN`. Expects a vector of two
 * PDG Codes, e.g. `SQRTS_N: [2212, 2212]` for proton-proton (that's the
 * default behaviour). The important part here is which mass is used for
 * the calculation \f$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \rightarrow \beta\f$.
 *
 * \todo It should be possible to say something like "take the average
 * mass of a particle in the nuclei". Maybe even "take the average mass
 * of a particle in this nucleus" (and specify the other one). This can
 * be done, e.g., by using a unknown or otherwise invalid PDG code.
 *
 * `Projectile:` Section for projectile nucleus. The projectile will
 * start at \f$z < 0\f$ and fly in positive \f$z\f$-direction, at \f$x
 * \ge 0\f$.
 *
 * `Target:` Section for target nucleus. The target will start at \f$z
 * > 0\f$ and fly in negative \f$z\f$-direction, at \f$x \le 0\f$.
 *
 * `Projectile:`/`Target:` options:
 * \li `PARTICLES:` A map in which the keys are PDG codes and the
 * values are number of particles with that PDG code that should be in
 * the current nucleus. E.g.\ `PARTICLES: {2212: 82, 2112: 126}` for a
 * lead-208 nucleus (82 protons and 126 neutrons = 208 nucleons), and
 * `PARTICLES: {2212: 1, 2112: 1, 3122: 1}` for Hyper-Triton (one
 * proton, one neutron and one Lambda).
 * \li `SOFTNESS:` The softness used in the Woods-Saxon distribution
 * for this nucleus.
 * 0 means a hard sphere.
 *
 * `Impact:` A section for the impact parameter (= distance of the two
 * straight lines that the center of masses of the nuclei travel on).
 *
 * \li `VALUE: `fixed value for the impact parameter. No other \a
 * Impact: directive is looked at.
 * \li `SAMPLE:` if `uniform`, use uniform sampling of the impact
 * parameter (\f$dP(b) = db\f$). If else, use areal input sampling
 * (the probability of an input parameter range is proportional to the
 * area corresponding to that range, \f$dP(b) = b\cdot db\f$).
 * \li `RANGE:` A vector of minimal and maximal impact parameters
 * between which b should be chosen. (The order of these is not
 * important.)
 * \li `MAX:` Like `RANGE: [0.0, MAX]`. Note that if both `RANGE` and
 * `MAX` are specified, `MAX` takes precedence.
 *
 * `INITIAL_DISTANCE:` The initial distance of the two nuclei. That
 * means \f$z_{\rm min}^{\rm target} - z_{\rm max}^{\rm projectile}\f$.
