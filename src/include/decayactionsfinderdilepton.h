 * \ingroup action
 * A dilepton decay finder:
 * Loops through all particles and if they can decay into dileptons, it
 * treats the decays with the shining method. This means in every timestep
 * it stores every possible decay in an extra action and later in the
 * write_dilepton_action routine in experiment.cc these decays are written
 * in the DileptonOutput. Because too many dileptons are produced this way,
 * every decay is weighted with the so called "shining_weight".
 * See \iref{Schmidt:2008hm}, chapter 2D.
 * The finder works with two body dilepton decays as well as with dalitz
 * dilepton decays.
