/**
 * Interface to the SMASH configuration files.
 *
 * The configuration is created from a YAML file and then stores a nested map of
 * maps (normally a tree, but YAML allows it to be cyclic - even though we don't
 * want that feature).
 *
 * Typical usage in SMASH needs to read the value once. In that case use the
 * Configuration::take function:
 * \code
 * double sigma = config.take({"General", "SIGMA"});
 * \endcode
 * Note the curly braces in the function call. It's a std::initializer_list of
 * strings. This allows an arbitrary nesting depth in all via the same function.
 * But as a consequence the keys must all be given as constant strings at
 * compile time.
 *
 * If you need to access configuration values from a run-time string you can use
 * Configuration::operator[]. This returns a Configuration object that
 * references the respective sub-tree.
 *
 * By taking values (instead of just reading), the configuration object should
 * be empty at the end of initialization. If the object is not empty then SMASH
 * will print a warning (using Configuration::unused_values_report). This can be
 * important for the user to discover typos in his configuration file (or
 * command line parameters).
