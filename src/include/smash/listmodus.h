 * \ingroup modus
 * ListModus: Provides a modus for running SMASH on an external particle list,
 * for example as an afterburner calculation.
 *
 * To use this modus, choose
    Modus:         List
 * \code
 * General:
 *      Modus: List
 * \endcode
 * in the configuration file.
 *
 * Options for ListModus go in the "Modi"â†’"List" section of the
 * configuration:
 *
 * \code
 * Modi:
 *      List:
 *              # options here
 * \endcode

 * For configuring see \ref input_modi_list_.
 *
 *
 * Since SMASH is searching for collisions in computational frame time 't',
 * all particles need to be at the same time. If this is not the case in
 * the list provided, the particles will be propagated backwards on
 * straight lines ("anti-freestreaming"). To avoid unphysical interactions
 * of these particles, the back-propagated particles receive a
 * formation_time and zero cross_section_scaling_factor. The cross-sections
 * are set to zero during the time, where the particle will just propagate
 * on a straight line again to appear at the formation_time into the system.
